                    Answer: 
                    <span class="g">
                        The Website Chat Does Not Pull From Discord, Only From A Server,
                        <br>
                        However, The Live Discord Chat Pulls From The Discord And You Can Message To The Discord.

                    3. Why Don't Some Of The Games Work In Method 2?
                </h3>
                <p class="y">
                    Answer: The 2nd Games Method Uses Regular Iframe Embedding, And Does Not Go Through The Proxy.
                    <br>
                    This Means That Those URLs Are Blocked For You.
                    <br>
                    If You Would Still Like To Play Those Games, I Reccomend:
                    <span class="g">
                        Using The First Games Method, Or Finding A Different URL

                <p class="y">
                    Answer: It May Be Due To Your School Districts' Policy That Doesnt Allow Forms
                    <br> 
                    Or Emails Outside Of The District
