This Is Infinite Campus
A Hopefully Unblocked Website That Allows You To Play Games, Browse The Web, And Much More.

WARNING:
If You Fork This Repo And Try To Run It, The Games And The Proxy Will Not Work
This Is Because This Repo Is Only The Public Folder For The Infinite Campus Server And Since The Proxy And Games Try To Contact The Proxy, They Will Fail If The Files Are Not There.
Unfortunately, I Cannot Put The Whole Server Setup On Here As It Would Expose My Discord Bot Token. And Even If I Removed It, It Still Wouldnt Be Able To Upload Here Because It Requires Lots More Special Tokens And Secrets.
If You Are Trying To Download The Website And Trying To Use It Without The Proxy, Or Games, Please Follow The Steps Below

Requirements: Node.js

Step 1: Click The Green Code Icon And Select Download Zip

Step 2: Extract The Zip File And Open The Folder With Everything In It In The Terminal

Step 3: Run node server.js

Step 4: Enter The Port You Would Like To Use Ex: 2000

Step 5: Select Either Local Or Network Modes (Network Allows Anyone On Your Network With The Url To Visit It)

Step 6: Go To The Url It Gives You
